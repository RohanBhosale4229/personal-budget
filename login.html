            <h1>How did this Assignment help my understanding of tags?</h1><br>
            <p>This assignment really helped me learn about different tag available in HTML<br>
                for example in this assignment I have tried playing with: 
                <br><h3>1.semantic tags:</h3><b>Segment, nav, footer, header</b>,

                <br><h3>2.SEO Tags:</h3><p>once I was comfortable with the semantic tags. I tried my hands on the SEO tags available 
                in HTML <br>I used <b>meta tag for description of the title in index page as well as login page</b>,<br>
                 used<b> amp</b> in html tag and image tag which helps in accelerating mobile pages
                 <br>and played with the <b>Canonical tag</b><br> also used <b>open graph</b>,
                 <br></p>
                
                 <h3>3.Accessibility tags(A11y):</h3> <p>I tried out few Accessibility options such as
                <br><abbr title="Attribute Tag"><b>abbr tag</b></abbr>,
               <br><br><b>Button tag</b><br><button> <a href="https://github.com/RohanBhosale4229/personal-budget">
                My github Repo</a></button>
               <br><br>and<b> Alternative Text</b><br><img amp src="1427.jpg" alt="Color pencils" height="100" width="100">
