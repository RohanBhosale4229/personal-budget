    <section class="container center"><h1>How did this Assignment help my understanding of tags?</h1>
    <p>This assignment really helped me learn about different tag available in HTML 
        for example in this assignment I have tried playing with: <h3>1.semantic tags:</h3><b>Segment, nav, footer, header</b>,
        <h3>2.SEO Tags:</h3><p>once I was comfortable with the semantic tags. I tried my hands on the SEO tags available 
        in HTML I used <b>Header tags(h1, h2, h3,etc.), meta tag</b>, <br>and played with the <b>Title tag</b>(never knew it is not a good practice for title to be more than 55)</p>
        <P><h3>3.Accessibility tags(A11y):</h3> </P><p>I will be trying out few Accessibility options such as <abbr title="Attribute Tag"><b>abbr tag</b></abbr>,
       <b>Button tag</b><button> <b>Click me</b></button>and <b><br>Alternative Text</b><img src="" alt="Color pencils"><i>(haven't added any image intentionally to check if the tag works, you can add image 1427.jpg to check the image)</i> </p>
